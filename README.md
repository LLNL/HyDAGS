## Hyperspectral Data Approximation with Gaussian Sigmoids (HyDAGS)

Title: HyDAGS, Version: 1.0
Author: Cory L. Lanker

### Purpose of this repository

This code provides an approximation of hyperspectral data with a sparse collection
of Gaussian Sigmoids.

These files are provided for replication of results and plots 
in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 in the journal paper:
