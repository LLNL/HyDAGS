Dr. Melissa Lane has graciously allowed these calcite emissivity measurements for distribution with this journal article and their general distribution for these analyses.
Copyright:  These calcite measurements provided in this CSV file are copyright to her, 1999, and are displayed in Figure 3(c) from her journal article that should be attributed in any derivative works.
Journal article:  Lane, Melissa D.  Midinfrared optical constants of calcite and their relationship to particle size effects in thermal emission spectra of granular calcite.  Journal of Geophysical Research, 1999, 104, no. E6, 14099–14108.
For complete data of these calcite emissivity measurements, please write to Dr. Melissa Lane at <lane@fibergyro.com>. These measurements have been reduced from their full size and values in the following ways:
(1) Our subset of the entire data is the 8.5 to 12.5 um range. (2) All wavelengths are rounded to 3 decimals. (3) All emissivities are rounded to 4 decimals.
